      What does it mean to live forever and how can one achieve it? The question of immortality has been boggling human minds for as long as humanity exists. So broad yet so potent, it has traveled throughout continents, cultures, and centuries, facilitating discussions, disputes, and pursuits, all in an effort to bring us closer to unraveling this burning mystery. 
      This never-ceasing quest through time and generations, in essence, is telling us something very profound about us: when faced with the unknown and unanswered, very often humans respond with a complex mix of curiosity and fear. This deadly mix is what dragged this search into today and turned the idea of extending our existence and ultimately demolishing death into a hard but rewarding challenge, at times an obsessive task, a “reality in the making”, driving us to go beyond what’s possible and try to solve the unsolvable.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="1">1</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Before I further indulge in this discussion, I want to make a small disclaimer. With this thesis I am not trying to claim that neither transcendence-oriented view on immortality nor digitalization of immortality are the only existing views, since these varied across cultures and times. By juxtapositioning these two, I am also not saying that one form of immortality is “realer” or “truer” than the other, since I can’t possibly know how real digital immortality will get, and I also don’t know how real or factual the transcendence-based immortality is and will, in fact, never know. I deliberately focus on Platonism with a brief mentioning of a few other philosophical/religious views which support the idea of immortality=transcendence, firstly, because these are the perspectives on life and death which I personally deeply relate to and let accompany me through my journey on this planet, and, secondly, I chose them as a clear, vivid, and representative counterpoint to the modern view on it. The broader aim is to trace the evolutionary transition of immortality from metaphysical to digital and see where an ancient concept re-emerges through today’s lense, where both align but also misalign. I will ponder what this transition says about our changing understanding of what it means to be human. Through this research and thesis I will try to analyse and reflect if modern immortality is pursuing the same thing just with different tools. Is digital a betrayal or a continuation of the human essence? How much of it is fear-based? How much of it is about the shift of mindset and values altogether? And where this search for immortality brought us today and the ethical, moral, legal, and philosophical complexities that are arising together with its gradual implementation.

  <h3 class="chapter-title">2 Digging the Philosophical Essence</h3>
  <div class="main-text">
    <p>
      Immortality is far from a modern concept. On the contrary, it was central to ancient philosophical reflections on the soul, happiness, values, as well as divinity<span class="footnote-number" data-note="2">2</span>, which through centuries has been looked at through a wide range of religious, cultural, mythological prisms and many other sub-prisms<span class="footnote-number" data-note="3">3</span>. From reincarnation cycles followed by ultimate liberation in Eastern traditions like Hinduism and Buddhism to bodily resurrection in Abrahamic faiths (like Christianity and Islam), and afterlife narratives in Ancient Egypt<span class="footnote-number" data-note="4">4</span>, visions of life after death have served to help us find bigger, deeper meaning in our mortality.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="5">5</span>
      In this chapter the focus will be on laying a philosophical and spiritual foundation of immortality and delving into a few ancient perspectives which treat it as a process of transformation and transcendence, which in return will help us understand the tensions at the core of this thesis.
    </p>

    <p>
      2.1 The Spiritual Core
     Across diverse cultures, immortality intertwined deeply with metaphysical worldviews. In early theological discourse, it was understood not simply as endless continuation but as incorruptibility. As defined in the King James Version Dictionary of the Bible, it is <em>“the quality of never ceasing to exist, exemption from death and annihilation; life destined to endure without end.”</em> It applies notably to the soul, described as <em>“having no principle of alteration or corruption; exempt from death”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="6">6</span>
    </p>

    <p>
     One of the earliest and most influential philosophical discussions of this idea appears in Plato’s Phaedo<span class="footnote-number" data-note="7">7</span>. In this text, Plato argues that the soul (psyche) is immortal and fundamentally distinct from the body. The soul’s true existence, he explains, transcends bodily life and belongs to the eternal and unchanging Forms – truth, justice, beauty. Death, therefore, is <em>“a release from the body”</em> that allows the soul to enter the true world, which is invisible to us but to which it is akin.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="8">8</span> Plato vividly contrasts the two: <em>“The soul is more like the divine, immortal, intelligible, uniform, indissoluble, and ever remaining selfsame, while the body is more like the mortal, sensible, unconscious, varying, and dissoluble”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="9">9</span> In the so-called “Final Argument,” the conclusion is that because the soul has life as its essential attribute, it cannot accept its opposite – death and is therefore <em>“deathless”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="10">10</span>
     Turning to the eastern views and their spiritual traditions, Hinduism, for example, understands the soul as eternal, seeking moksha – release from the cycle of rebirth and union with the ultimate reality, Brahman<span class="footnote-number" data-note="11">11</span>. The Upanishads, ancient religious and philosophical texts of Hinduism, also declare that the Self, the true essence of the individual, consists of knowledge, mind, and life-breath, and is undecaying, undying, immortal, and fearless.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="12">12</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Buddhism, while denying a permanent self and encouraging disattachement from one’s physical and mental forms, emphasizes that the ultimate goal is to achieve nirvana, the cessation of suffering and rebirth. <em>“Those of the middle type are motivated by the wish for release from all suffering and rebirth, in other words the freedom that is nirvana, enlightenment.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="13">13</span> Thus, one can conclude that Buddhism sees immortality not in eternal survival of a self, but in progression and the unconditioned freedom one is granted at the end of their journey.
    </p>

   <p>
    Overall, across the above-mentioned traditions and schools of thought, death is seen as a transformative passage, a gateway, a transition to oneness or truth beyond individuality and separation. Socrates metaphorically compares the body to a prison, precisely: <em>“trying to understand goodness and begin to separate the soul from the body and so prepare it for the full separation that is death, freed, as it were, from the bonds of the body.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="14">14</span> Dorothea Frede sums up this idea as death being not destruction but the soul’s release and return to its rightful eternal place.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="15">15</span>
   </p>

   <p>
    2.2 Liberation over Preservation
    Although ancient traditions have varying degrees of concordance regarding the soul’s journey after death, all the above-mentioned traditions talk about liberation as the end goal in one way or another. Classical philosophies frame the soul as an immaterial, eternal essence. For Plato, the soul’s survival depends not on personal continuity but on its eternal nature. True immortality, therefore, means transcendence and transformation – <em></em>“a movement away from all bodily passions and the body itself”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="16">16</span> rather than the indefinite preservation of one’s bodily or mental self.
   </p>

   <p>
    I like how Gustav Theodor Fechner’s in his “The Little Book of Life After Death”, speaks about the same idea by echoing ancient motifs, just with a modern touch. He expresses the theory that human life comprises three stages: <em>“Man lives upon the earth not once, but three times. His first stage of life is a continuous sleep; the second is an alternation between sleeping and waking; the third is an eternal waking. In the first stage man lives alone in darkness; in the second he lives with companions, but detached and in a light which pictures for him the exterior; in the third his life is merged with that of other souls into the higher life of the Supreme Spirit, and he discerns the reality of ultimate things. The passing from the first to the second stage is called birth; the transition from the second to the third is called death.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="17">17</span> Death to him is therefore not an end but a passage into fuller reality, away from earthly constraints.
   </p>

   <p>
    This spiritual framework contrasts sharply with contemporary technological interpretations of immortality, which center on preserving the “core self” via data, memory uploads, digital avatars etc. Rather than seeking liberation from the material self, our society as it is today pursues indefinite preservation and replication of identity through artificial means. And this is where my personal perception of reality and the witnessed objective reality come into conflict. I cannot but wonder, what is the existential status of these digitally preserved selves? What kind of immortality do those modern forms of preservation represent? And crucially, what consequences result from this shift? Thus, this tension between preservation and liberation becomes a focal point for evaluating the ethical, metaphysical, and practical implications of digital immortality.

  <h3 class="chapter-title">3  Death is Optional: Digital Immortality</h3>
  <div class="main-text">
    <p>
    In the world that we live in today, the frequency and intensity with which people engage with the topic of immortality have significantly increased. What it seems to me is that we took the philosophical aspirations from the past and transformed them drastically, if not turned them upside down completely. The idea of existing forever no longer lives as a mind-boggling speculation or mere spiritual aspiration, it is now deeply tied to the digital technologies that permeate our daily lives. Digital space, originally thought of as a fun addition to our lives, meant to improve our connectedness and speed of communication with the world, has soon evolved into a complex branched ecosystem on its own.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="18">18</span> And as people grew more and more accustomed to the digital realm, the separation between the “real” and the “virtual” became harder to define. For many, their digital presence became an identity on its own, a separate form of existence. The fact that, as of today, we are so intertwined and dependent on digital technologies, makes us much more susceptible and likely to accept our further merging with them<span class="footnote-number" data-note="19">19</span>, creating a solid base for concepts such as digital immortality to gain their momentum. As stated by David Burden in his academic paper “The Ethics and Impact of Digital Immortality”: <em>“As people establish on-line identities and repositories, the likelihood that their digital presences will persist beyond their death increases, especially as the use of virtual personal assistants grows.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="20">20</span> The contemporary dialogue on digital immortality intricately intertwines with advances modern technologies, which collectively fuel hopes that human consciousness can be preserved or resurrected indefinitely in digital form.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="21">21</span> As seen by the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler, memory can no longer exist without technical support and that the future of immortality is already entwined with the technical objects we build.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="22">22</span> And whether we are against it will be the last thing those who profit care about anyway. What we hear nowadays is that death is no longer an inevitable conclusion of life, but is, on the other hand, a beginning of something much greater: a reality where people chose to inhabit a virtual paradise which is as appealing as a real one (if not more), where living meet their deceased relatives, where feelings and experiences reach a new extended form and memories are never forgotten. Perfect, isn’t it? Well, in another polished advertisement advocating for digital immortality it will be. What it might, on the contrary, end up looking like, is that a dystopian storyline from distant Black Mirror<span class="footnote-number" data-note="23">23</span> episode has exited the screens and cinema halls and gradually entered our daily lives, whether we are ready for it or not. But ‘might’ is distant enough, right? 
    </p>

    <p>
    3.1 From Concept to Application
    Digital immortality can be described as ‘the continuation of an active or passive digital presence after death, enabled by advances in AI, data mining, and knowledge management, allowing the deceased to maintain some form of presence and interaction in digital space.’<span class="footnote-number" data-note="24">24</span> Doug DeGroot, as cited in a cultural memory symposium, concludes: <em>“Digital immortality can be roughly considered as involving a person-centric repository containing a copy of everything a person sees, hears, says, or experiences over his or her lifespan – videos, audio recordings, writings, thoughts, personality traits, emotion profiles, thoughts, beliefs, and appearance are also captured and integrated into an interactive conversational AI agent/avatar which is placed in charge of the collected material and presents the illusion of having the factual memories and mind of the person.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="25">25</span> I think it’s quite fitting that he specifically uses the word ‘illusion’ in his description, highlighting the separation of what is real and what pretends to be or wants to be perceived as such.
    </p>

    <p>
    But even though it may be illusory, it employs a broad array of real tools and technologies, each contributing uniquely to the goal of preserving or simulating human presence beyond biological life. Michio Kaku, futurist and physicist, optimistically sees digital immortality as well attainable, saying: <em>“The rate at which we are learning about longevity gives one pause. It makes you realize that perhaps digital and genetic immortality are within reach”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="26">26</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    Before delving into the technologies in use, it makes sense to identify three categories of digital immortality creators, as outlined by the scholars Maggi Savin-Baden and David Burden<span class="footnote-number" data-note="27">27</span>: 1) Memory creators–static or semi-static digital memorials of someone before and/or after their death. 2) Avatar creators–interactive digital avatars with some ability to conduct a limited conversation representing the deceased, with minimal likelihood of being mistaken for someone who is a live human: virtual humanoid. 3) Persona creators–AI interactive personas that evolve and can interact realistically with the world; high likelihood of being mistaken for a live human (virtual human, chatbot, griefbot). This showcases that digital immortality is not a single thing but a spectrum of practices and technologies, from static memorial pages to fully interactive AI personas. At the far end of this continuum lies one the most radical and long-term visioned proposal, which is mind uploading. Popularized by thinkers like Ray Kurzweil and philosopher Nick Bostrom, mind uploading involves digitally replicating the human brain’s structure and functions to achieve continued existence in <em>“a digital substrate and endowing their liberated spirits with exquisitely good-feeling virtual embodiments.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="28">28</span> The ambition to upload one’s consciousness into a digital space depends on capturing neural structures, personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and memory. Kurzweil describes the eventual mapping of the brain’s connectedness between neurons as a gateway to <em>“digital and genetic immortality”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="29">29</span>, while also asking crucial critical questions about authenticity and genuineness: <em>“Since we constantly changing, are we just patterns? What if someone copies that pattern? Am I the original and/or the copy?”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="30">30</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    While still largely theoretical and experimental, projects like the Blue Brain Project<span class="footnote-number" data-note="31">31</span> and Neuralink<span class="footnote-number" data-note="32">32</span> aim at detailed brain mapping, which is a preliminary step toward mind uploading. Startups such as Nectome<span class="footnote-number" data-note="33">33</span> offer brain preservation technology based on chemical solution that would be injected into people while still alive, aiming at a future where preserved minds could hypothetically be scanned and digitized.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="34">34</span> Nectome’s co-founder, Robert McIntyre, frames it as a hopeful “backup” for future scientists to simulate the mind, emphasizing that <em>“the user experience will be identical to physician-assisted suicide”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="35">35</span> While that might sound quite radical and adventuristic, his further comment, <em>“Product-market fit is people believing that it works”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="36">36</span> to me personally has a more of an ironical connotation, since so far it’s not about whether the product actually works, but whether people believe in it working. Other projects, like LifeNaut<span class="footnote-number" data-note="37">37</span>, are one of the companies claiming to be offering chatbot-based versions of digital immortality where one can archive individuals’ digital footprints, biometric data, and personal narratives to enable dynamic posthumous interaction, reflecting continuity of self through preserved memory.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="38">38</span> The project investigates the “Terasem Hypotheses,” which propose that <em>“a conscious analogue of a person may be created by combining sufficiently detailed data about the person (a ‘mindfile’) using future consciousness software (‘mindware’)”</em>. Secondly, it states that <em>“such a conscious analogue can be downloaded into a biological or nanotechnological body to provide life experiences comparable to those of a typically birthed human.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="39">39</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    Brain-Machine Interfaces is the current “bridge” technology that connects living brains to machines but doesn’t yet upload the mind; it shows the incremental path toward the radical goal. Conceptualized primarily by companies like Neuralink, brain-machine interfaces aim to connect biological neural activity with digital systems, potentially facilitating more immersive and direct digital preservation. Musk himself has stated: <em>“Ultimately, we can do a full brain-machine interface where we can achieve a sort of symbiosis with AI”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="40">40</span> Their long-term vision includes linking humans with artificial intelligence to not just overcome cognitive limitations, but also possibly achieve a digital form of immortality.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="41">41</span> However, former Neuralink employees and experts question the methods and means of the research, emphasizing the ethical and safety risks involved.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="42">42</span> At this stage it is still quite experimental, but the vision and aspiration is definitely there and who knows how long it takes before the full scale roll-out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, I would like to discuss AI-driven avatars, which represent today’s most practical and widely deployed approach to digital presence after death. Some time ago, while doing research on my topic, I stumbled across a documentary called “Meeting You”.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="43">43</span> In that documentary, a grieving mother reunites with a digital representation of her deceased daughter. While watching it, I experienced a range of mixed feelings. Developers of this VR experience stated that their intention was to aid the grieving process by allowing the mother an immersive, sensory interaction which was supposed to give this mother a chance to say a proper goodbye, get a feeling of reassurance that her daughter is no longer in pain and finally let her go.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="44">44</span> The intention might have been good, but something tells me that the human psyche is far more complex to be able to handle it in a way it was hoped to be handled. Regardless, this right here is an example of how this technology is being integrated into our lives today.
    </p>

    <p>
    Overall, AI-driven avatars work by creating digital representations of individuals using artificial intelligence techniques that analyze and replicate their communication style, personality traits, memories, and sometimes even appearance and voice. The technology relies on collecting and processing extensive personal data – such as text messages, emails, social media posts, videos, and voice recordings to train AI models that can generate responses and behaviors similar to those of the original person. As writer Luca Sisto notes, the goal <em>“is to get closer to creating a digital avatar that would be able to reproduce us and replace us once we’re dead”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="45">45</span> There are a number of platforms which try to do just that. One is Replika<span class="footnote-number" data-note="46">46</span>, a generative AI chatbot app which offers a personalized conversational partner and does that through learning from user data and interactions and also has an ability to evolve emotionally and intellectually.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="47">47</span> Another one, called Project December<span class="footnote-number" data-note="48">48</span> was developed using GPT-based technology and enables users to create AI personas reflecting deceased individuals. The main use case is to simulate conversations with deceased loved ones, offering grieving individuals a platform to reconnect, seek reassurance, or find emotional condolence. Rohrer emphasizes technology’s role: <em>“It can help people achieve closure through continued conversation but also faces risks like high cost and potential overuse”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="49">49</span> Another start-up app called Eternime<span class="footnote-number" data-note="50">50</span> decided to go even further and envisioned to build an immersive living with dead communication with a help of realistic 3d avatars. However, this company turned into a ghost a few years later, with the only remnants of its existence being outdated articles from distant 2014, echoing both big ambitions and enormous challenges when it comes to actually making digital immortality a reality.
    </p>

    <p>
    Regardless of the current stand of these platforms, the core issue here, as Houman Barekat rightfully observed, is that <em>“these pseudo-beings will only ever be as good as the recycled information they are made up of, so that ‘reality becomes just a question of imaginative storytelling and retelling.’”</em> He further notes that <em>“the thing that distinguishes a human being from a mere automaton — let’s call it, for the sake of argument, a soul — will be crucially lacking.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="51">51</span> Subsequently, these griefbots blur lines between therapeutic tools and unhealthy oblivion and raise a number of fundamental concerns that I will discuss in the following subchapters.
    </p>

    <p>
    3.2 Why We Seek to Digitalize
    Every epoch and every innovation has its driving force and a need it is trying to cover. The stimulus for a development of digital immortality technologies must subsequently stem from a range of deep-seated existential, psychological, and cultural factors. Probably one of the most obvious and ‘burning factors’, as I call them, is the fear of death. The universal angst of mortality and not knowing what comes after pushes peoples’ desire for self-preservation beyond biological limits and digital immortality offers a modern solution, and by doing so, soothes the so called “death anxiety”.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="52">52</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    Another reason behind the heightened interest in digital preservation came to me in form of a single word as I was writing this thesis - legacy. All the modern interpretations and layerings aside, legacy is a timeless desire of ours. And just like a poet’s verses would keep on living after the author’s death and influencing the world generations later, digital preservation platforms nowadays serve and tailor to this exact psychological need to ensure ongoing remembrance and impact. And while legacy is driving people for innovative solutions, let’s not exclude grief as another potent factor in play. Those in deep mourning and those wishing to experience proper closure will look for any possibility to obtain it. And yes, these technologies might offer a chance to say that one last goodbye, but how much of it is self-pacification and delusion at the end of the day? Since digital copies may fail to capture the consciousness or “selfhood” of the original, risking a form of simulated but soulless duplication<span class="footnote-number" data-note="53">53</span> or what Tim Tietz would call them <em>“digital zombies”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="54">54</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Silicon Valley culture, for example, death has been increasingly framed as a technological problem to be solved rather than an existential inevitability. The narrative is that with enough innovation, aging and death can be engineered away or avoided through algorithms and data. This shift reflects a broader “engineering approach” that treats human mortality as a design flaw rather than a natural boundary, transforming the quest for immortality into a technical problem.</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="55">55</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    3.3 Exposing the Dark Side
    Despite its promise, digital immortality presents substantial risks that echo and amplify existing societal gaps and raise novel ethical dilemmas. First of all, advanced digital immortality technologies remain substantially expensive, potentially creating a posthumous elite able to have access to prolonged digital existence, thereby reinforcing and worsening social injustice and inequality.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="56">56</span> This problem is far from novel, while manifesting in various aspects of our societal structures, here too, as Ananya Singh noted, <em>“the orientation towards profit would end up determining who, and what, is preserved”</em>,<span class="footnote-number" data-note="57">57</span> and together with it reinforcing existing power imbalances instead of posing it as a universal human opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
    Equally, if not more important issue technologies described above may pose, is that they might mess up heavily with natural grieving processes and loss acceptance, fostering unhealthy attachments or delaying acceptance of loss.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="58">58</span> As discussed by Kawtar Rettab, <em>“The concern is that people may cling to the AI clones rather than forming new relationships and healing, which may worsen the effects of Prolonged Mourning Disorder (PMD), wherein one’s functioning and life is disrupted due to immense lingering grief.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="59">59</span> And even though this technology might not be convincing enough yet, Mark Alhermizi rightfully states: <em>“One day they will be good, and I think about what the consequences are for people using them. Forget about ethics, it’s about them living in a false reality. Not just not moving on with grief, but not moving on with their lives”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="60">60</span> 
    </p>

    <p>
    And has anyone thought of the deceased themselves? Who governs digital replicas and how data might be exploited without the deceased’s control? What if deceased individuals themselves suffered psychologically if trapped in a digital existence without meaningful interaction or the possibility of ending this form of existence?<span class="footnote-number" data-note="61">61</span> These are the profound uncertainties which relate to consent and privacy, as much as they relate to moral and legal concerns. Consent is especially fraught; deceased individuals cannot grant explicit permission for posthumous data use and without regulation, avatars can be altered, manipulated, or exploited, which can violate dignity and autonomy of both deceased and living relatives.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="62">62</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is another question worth asking: then who owns the Data-Soul, and who decides what version lives on? Digital immortality has become entwined with powerful corporate interests. AI companies benefit from gathering intimate user data, which fuels not only the personalization of chatbots but also generates valuable behavioral insights for monetization.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="63">63</span> Ongoing manipulation – rewriting memories or using deadbots in commercial, political, or educational spheres, all of it raises real challenges. In mind came a widely reposted case where AI “reanimation” was used for testifying in court, and critics warn this is an “ethical mess.”<span class="footnote-number" data-note="64">64</span> Many Terms&Conditions documents do not explicitly address postmortem rights or responsibilities.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="65">65</span> Some companies and platforms frequently claim broad licenses over user-generated avatars. As Meta states: <em>“While you retain ownership of your avatar or digital twin, you are also granting Meta a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use it”.</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="66">66</span> In other words, they were nice enough to let you know that they can use your data in whichever way whenever they want, but there’s nothing new under the sun anyway. TikTok and similar platforms assert rights to reproduce and distribute digital likenesses, raising deep concerns about user autonomy after death.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="67">67</span> “Creating and using digital recreations without explicit permission can infringe on the rights of the deceased and their families”.</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="68">68</span> At the end of the day, the disposition of digital remains – who can edit, retire, or deactivate them largely depends on provider discretion, not universal law.<em>
    </p>

    <p>
    What adds complicity to it, is the addictive qualities of griefbots. Companion AI such as Replika encourage prolonged user interaction, which extends data collection opportunities and increases subscription or in-app purchase revenue.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="69">69</span> This business model risks exploiting vulnerable grieving users by deepening emotional dependence. Project December illustrates this tension very well. Although lauded for emotional support, its pay-as-you-go credit system which motivates companies to maximize engagement without any regard to potential psychological impacts.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="70">70</span> 
    </p>

    <p>
    Conclusively, the move from notions of an eternal soul to data-driven and algorithmic immortality signifies a profound cultural and philosophical shift. Yet, this new dimention we are entering requires careful navigation of social, ethical, and metaphysical tensions that redefine what it means to live beyond death. Michio Kaku, futurist and physicist, sees digital immortality as very much graspable, saying: <em,>“The rate at which we are learning about longevity gives one pause. It makes you realize that perhaps digital and genetic immortality are within reach”</em>.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="71">71</span> And while there is always a mixture of hope, fear, scepticism and irony present whenever something new enters the scene, it is hard to deny that our relationship with death is being continuesly and gradually reshaped, and one can only wonder whether it is for the better.

  <h3 class="chapter-title">4  Soul vs Data</h3>
  <div class="main-text">
    <p>
    At the heart of the digital immortality debate lies a profound philosophical tension between two visions of posthumous existence. On one side there is this utopian vision of exploration and eternal existence – the hope that through digital continuance, the self may escape mortal constraints, achieving a new form of existence beyond the finite body. On the other, there is a gloomy prospect of self-looping – a preservation of data that simulates life without truly continuing it, creating echoes imprisoned within the digital realm with no meaning or end. With the help of a selected number of contemporary philosophers and theorists, I will delve into the soul-data dilemma deeper with the argumentation predominantly focusing on the dystopian side. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Digital immortality often relies on the construction of a “data-self” – a digital representation composed of numerous traces selected from a person’s behaviors, preferences, and interactions. This data-self functions as an avatar: assembled and recreated remnants of past identity. Luciano Floridi, in his “The Fourth Revolution: How the Infosphere is Reshaping Human Reality”,<span class="footnote-number" data-note="72">72</span> argues that through the continuity of information, personal identity can be preserved, and even transcended. Yet, his theory faced criticism, since by reducing oneself to information, the “data-self” risks becoming a mere simulacrum – a representation or imitation of something. Following up with this counterargument, Houman Barekat has rightfully pointed out in his book review<span class="footnote-number" data-note="73">73</span>, <em>“Attempts to enable the dead to achieve ‘digital immortality’—through bots, holograms, and digital ‘counterparts’—are altogether less wholesome. These operate by means of an elaborate deception, drawing on preexisting digital data to produce a simulacrum, replacing, as Sisto explains, ‘the physical person, in the process of decomposition, with their digital surrogate.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="74">74</span> The digital self, thus, in his view, loops infinitely on past information but does not generate novel sense of consciousness or genuine self-awareness. Katherine Hayles further problematizes the notion of a disembodied data-self in “How We Became Posthuman”. Hayles insists that identity is a property of complex interactions of body, brain, and environment, not simply data that can be uploaded, replicated, or archived. Hayles argues that the belief that <em>“consciousness can be uploaded into a computer”</em> is a dangerous fiction that ignores the embodied nature of the self.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="75">75</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    The discussion of whether consciousness, in a deeper sense, can partake in the process of digitalization was further explored by Yuval Harari. In his book “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow”<span class="footnote-number" data-note="76">76</span> he specifically discusses the gap between memory and consciousness. He introduces the concept of <em>“dataism”</em>, describing a worldview in which human identity is increasingly defined through data flows and algorithms, where every aspect of human life  is recorded, tracked, and analyzed, ultimately allowing algorithms to make decisions about one’s relationships, career, and even moral choices. Here one can clearly sense how he screams in skepticism about the global datafication humans are willingly and unwillingly doing to themselves. By contrasting traditional self-knowledge acquiring practices with algorithmic self-knowledge, he highlights the absurdity of our modern habits and mindset as a whole. Ultimately, he suggests that adopting this reality risks reducing the richness of life to mere decision-making processes, overlooking its deeper meaning: <em>“Dataism gains a better and better understanding of decision-making processes, but it might be adopting an increasingly skewed view of life.”</em> Eventually risking loosing autonomy altogether: <em>“We are striving to engineer the Internet-of-All-Things in the hope that it will make us healthy, happy and powerful. Yet once the Internet-of-All-Things is up and running, we might be reduced from engineers to chips, then to data, and eventually we might dissolve within the data torrent like a clump of earth within a gushing river.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="77">77</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    Indeed, at the core of the soul vs. data dilemma is the distinction between memory and consciousness. Memory, in digital immortality, becomes the basis for identity preservation: past social media activity, sent text and voice messages, photos, videos, and other digital footprints, all of which are gathered and turned into data-self. This archive is then used to offer interactions with chatbots or avatars modeled on the deceased, supposedly preserving <em>“who they were.”</em> But consciousness – the subjective, first-person experience, goes beyond mere memory. It consists of self-reflective awareness, qualia<span class="footnote-number" data-note="78">78</span>, embodiment, emotionality, and a rich variety of gathered experience that cannot be reduced to data. Those advocating for digital immortality very often mix the two notions and propose that as long as the memory continues to live, so does the person. Harari argues that <em>“At present we have no idea how or why data flows could produce consciousness and subjective experiences. Maybe we’ll discover that organisms aren’t algorithms after all.”</em> He notes that while human experiences and feelings may be digitized or turned into data streams, these data streams are distinct from the lived reality of those experiences. This aligns with the idea that translating feelings to data does not capture the emotional or conscious essence. Hayles, in her turn, insists that the body’s materiality is not a ‘prison’ for consciousness but rather the very condition for its emergence. Removing the body transforms identity into an empty informational pattern, capable of interaction but deprived of existential depth and meaning.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="79">79</span> Digital copies thus end up resembling <em>“dead data”</em>. They may simulate conversations and relive memories, but <em>“they are algorithms without souls”</em> incapable of independent awareness or will. 
    </p>

    <p>
    After all, сan digital immortality truly “solve” death? What it promises is, how Harari frames it, not immortality, but rather <em>“amortality”</em> – indefinite existence of digital subjects outside biological life or death. <em>“For modern people death is a technical problem. And every technical problem has a technical solution.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="80">80</span> The hope is to erase the expiry date and live indefinitely, not to achieve invincibility. This might have introduced a new category of existence and pacified some of those who believe in it as a form of survival, but ultimately what it does is that it shifts the meaning, but doesn’t eradicate death itself. It might sound like bad news for some, as exalting to others, it’s a matter of perspective after all. It seems to me that digital immortality does not solve death in a metaphysical sense, but rather opens another dimension to the perception and ways of dealing with it.

  <h3 class="chapter-title">5 Final Pondering</h3>
  <div class="main-text">
    <p>
    Mortality – is defined and understood as a condition of our finiteness as biological species.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="81">81</span> It shapes who we strive to be and how we strive to live, it defines our values, actions, aspirations and certainly gives meaning to our existence. Nowadays, with all the technological advancements, time speeding up<span class="footnote-number" data-note="82">82</span> (literal and perceived), our ever-evolving self-understanding, and rapid global transformations, what mortality signified and meant, might be in the process of changing forever. Not only might the new reality evoke deep existential concerns at the individual level, the established world orders, systems and structures<span class="footnote-number" data-note="83">83</span> supporting this traditional, conventional definition might start collapsing too.<span class="footnote-number" data-note="84">84</span> As the foundations of our understanding of life and death become destabilized, major pillars of society like law, ethics, education, religion, culture, science, and governance may require rethinking, potentially triggering profound transformations in how humanity organizes itself and what it deems as meaningful and important. As Kauffman said, <em>“We can say that death is at the root of consciousness, normative law and human existence…The loss of death is likely to radically alter who or what the being or creature is.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Whether digital immortality  and its means of execution deepen human meaning by extending our presence and opening up new possibilities for humanity altogether or diminish it by replacing embodied experience and eroding the notion of what it means to be human remains an open question. A lot of what I have discussed in this thesis is still in the transitory state from a possibility to reality. At this point in time it felt very adventurous and somehow pioneering to look into these emerging technologies and reflect on the possibilities and the future that might be awaiting us.
    </p>

    <p>
    My way of drawing the line would be quoting Alexander G. Long, who captures both the essence of my argument and the framework of this thesis in a few eloquent words: <em>“Humans strive to achieve immortality, instead of recognizing an essentially immortal part of themselves.”</em><span class="footnote-number" data-note="85">85</span>

    <p>
    Considering the philosophical foundation of this thesis and my advocacy for and dedication to living and lived reality, a deep reflection session feels like a proper afterword for this thesis. So here are a few question I’d like to invite you to muse on with me:

   <p>Are you afraid of death? Why?</p>
   <p>What immortality means to you?</p>
   <p>Could you define 'selfhood'?</p>
   <p>Are you listening attentively to the advice the trees are giving you?</p>
   <p>How do you make time slow down?</p>
   <p>What did love teach you about the vastness of your being?</p>
   <p> Are you conscious of your consciousness?</p>
   <p>Where was the most breathtaking sunset you have ever witnessed?</p>
   <p>What does it mean to truly live?</p>
